# Ambient Mode Video Player

A dynamic ambient mode video player inspired by Googleâ€™s Ambient Mode and YouTube reels.

## Description

This project recreates an ambient mode experience by analyzing the video content in real-time and changing the background color to match the dominant colors of the video frames. The ambient background smoothly transitions as the video plays, enhancing the viewing experience with immersive visuals.

## How It Works

1. **Video Playback:** The user watches a video or reel within the player.
2. **Color Extraction:** Frames from the video are periodically captured and processed to extract dominant colors.
3. **Background Update:** The background color dynamically changes to match the extracted dominant color, with smooth transitions.
4. **Continuous Sync:** The process repeats to keep the background color synced with the video content in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time color extraction from video frames.
